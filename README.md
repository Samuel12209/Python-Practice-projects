## Additional Python Project Ideas
## Still haven’t found a Python project idea that appeals to you? Here are many more, separated by experience level.



## These aren’t tutorials; they’re ideas that you’ll have to dig into and research on your own, but that’s part of the fun! And it’s part of the natural process of learning to code and working as a programmer. 



# The pros use Google for answers all the time — so don’t be afraid to dive in and get your hands dirty!



## Python Project Ideas: Beginner Level
## Create a code generator. This can that take text as input, replaces each letter with another letter, and outputs the “encoded” message.



## Build a countdown calculator. Write some code that can take two dates as input, and then calculate the amount of time between them. This will be a great way to familiarize yourself with Python’s datetime module.



## Write a sorting method. Given a list, can you write some code that sorts it alphabetically, or numerically? Yes, Python has this functionality built-in, but see if you can do it without using sort()!



## Build an interactive quiz application. Which Avenger are you? Build a personality or recommendation quiz that asks users some questions, stores their answers, and then performs some kind of calculation to give the user a personalized result based on their answers



## Tic-Tac-Toe by Text. Build a Tic-Tac-Toe game that’s playable like a text adventure. Can you make it print a text-based representation of the board after each move?



## Make a temperature/measurement converter. Write a script that can convert Fahrenheit to Celcius and back, or inches to centimeters and back, etc. How far can you take it?



## Build a counter app. Take your first steps into the world of UI by building a very simple app that counts up by one each time a user clicks a button.



## Build a number-guessing game. Think of this as a bit like a text adventure, but with numbers. How far can you take it?



## Build an alarm clock. This is borderline beginner/intermediate, but it’s worth trying to build an alarm clock for yourself. Can you create different alarms? A snooze function?



## Python Project Ideas: Intermediate Level
## Build an upgraded code generator. Starting with the project mentioned in the beginner section, see what you can do to make it more sophisticated. Can you make it generate different kinds of codes? Can you create a “decoder” app that reads encoded messages if the user inputs a secret key? Can you create a more sophisticated code that goes beyond simple letter-replacement?



## Make your Tic-Tac-Toe game clickable. Building off the beginner project, now make a version of Tic-Tac-Toe that has an actual UI  you’ll use by clicking on open squares. Challenge: can you write a simple “AI” opponent for a human player to play against?



## Scrape some data to analyze. This could really be anything, from any website you like. The web is full of interesting data, and if you learn a little about web-scraping, you can collect some really unique datasets.



## Build a clock website. How close can you get it to real-time? Can you implement different time zone selectors, and add in the “countdown calculator” functionality to calculate lengths of time?



## Automate some of your job. This will vary, but many jobs have some kind of repetitive process that you can automate! This intermediate project could even lead to a promotion.



## Automate your personal habits. Do you want to remember to stand up once every hour during work? How about writing some code that generates unique workout plans based on your goals and preferences? There are a variety of simple apps you can build for yourself to automate or enhance different aspects of your life.



## Create a simple web browser. Build a simple UI that accepts  URLs  and loads webpages. PyWt will be helpful here! Can you add a “back” button, bookmarks, and other cool features?



## Write a notes app. Create an app that helps people write and store notes. Can you think of some interesting and unique features to add?



## Build a typing tester. This should show the user some text, and then challenge them to type it — while timing them and scoring them on for accuracy.



## Create a “site updated” notification system. Ever get annoyed when you have to refresh a website to see if an out-of-stock product has been relisted, or to see if any news has been posted? Write a Python script that automatically checks a given URL for updates and informs you when it identifies one. (Be careful not to overload the servers of whatever site you’re checking, though — keep the time interval reasonable between each check).



## Recreate your favorite board game in Python. There are tons of options here, from something simple like Checkers all the way up to Risk — or even more modern and advanced games like Ticket to Ride or Settlers of Catan. How close can you get to the real thing?



## Build a Wikipedia explorer. Build an app that displays a random Wikipedia page. The challenge here is in the details: can you add user-selected categories? Can you try a different “rabbit hole” version of the app, wherein each article is randomly selected from the articles linked in the previous article? This might seem simple, but it can actually require some serious web-scraping skills.



## Python Project Ideas: Advanced Level
Build a stock market prediction app. For this one, you’ll need a source of stock market data and some machine learning and data analytics skills, but many people have tried this, so there’s plenty of source code out there to work from.



## Build a chatbot. The challenge here isn’t so much making the chatbot as it is making it good. Can you, for example, implement some natural language processing techniques to make it sound more natural and spontaneous?



## Program a robot. This requires some hardware (which isn’t usually free), but there are many affordable options out there — and many learning resources, too. Definitely look into Raspberry Pi if you’re not already thinking along those lines.



## Build an image recognition app. Starting with handwriting recognition is a good idea — Dataquest even has a guided data science project to help with that! — but once you’ve learned it, you can take it to the next level.



## Create a sentiment analysis tool for social media. Collect data from various social media platforms, preprocess it, and then train a deep learning model to analyze the sentiment of each post (positive, negative, neutral).



## Make a price prediction model. Select an industry or product that interests you, and build a machine learning model that predicts price changes.



## Create an interactive map. This will require a mix of data skills and UI creation skills. Your map can display whatever you’d like — bird migrations, traffic data, crime reports — but it should be interactive in some way. How far can you take it?
